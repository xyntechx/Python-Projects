# Portal
'Portal' is a two-player luck-based board game similar to 'Snakes and Ladders'. When playing, the objective of each player is simple: get to the end first! By simply rolling a dice, moving, and teleporting, you will be able to play 'Portal' with a friend and have loads of fun together!

## How to Play
- When prompted, press Enter to roll the dice. The number you get (n) will be displayed!
- You will move forward by n boxes after rolling the dice.
- If you land on a portal after moving n boxes, you will be teleported to where another portal is. Do note that there is a chance for you to remain where you are (teleported to the portal you are already on).
- If you roll the dice and land exactly on the last box or beyond, you win!

## Note
The board for 'Portal' is a 10x10 board dotted with 15 portals. The portals' positions are different for every game; the board is randomly generated.

The figure below shows an example of the board.
