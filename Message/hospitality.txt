A big thank-you to you both for letting me crash at your place (again) during the conference. You always make me feel just like family.
Thanks for the great time... and the great memories.
Thank you so much for hosting my shower. I felt like a total VIP.
My heartfelt thanks to you for opening your home to me during my visit. I loved every minute of my stay.
What a great party! You really know how to make good times happen. Thank you for letting me be part of it.
Thank you for a lovely evening filled with laughter and good conversation. I’m still smiling.
Thank you for the unforgettable meal. You’re incredible.
Your home is so warm, welcoming and delightful. I felt so pampered.
I didn’t want to leave. Don’t let that scare you - I promise not to show up all packed and ready to move in. It’s tempting, though.
You spoiled me rotten! The delicious food. The comfy bed. The company. The fun. Thanks for everything!
I felt like Goldilocks. Everything was JUST RIGHT.
