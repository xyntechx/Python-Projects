You’re the best.
I’m humbled and grateful.
You knocked me off my feet!
My heart is still smiling.
Your thoughtfulness is a gift I will always treasure.
Sometimes the simplest things mean the most.
The banana bread was fabulous. You made my day.
I’m touched beyond words.
All I can say is wow! (Except, of course, I’m grateful.)
My heart just keeps thanking you and thanking you.
You’re a blessing to me.
Thank you for being my angel.
