# Escape
This is a text-based adventure game set in a 10x10 maze (although to be fair, it's just a room that you have to escape from _haha_). This is an original game I programmed to keep me and you entertained because honestly, it's a pretty fun one. All in all, feel free to play the game yourself and I hope you find it exciting!
